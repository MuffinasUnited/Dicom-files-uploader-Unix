# üì¶ DICOM Uploader Script for PACS

This Bash script automates the process of uploading DICOM files to a PACS server from a watched directory. It uses DCMTK tools (`storescu`, `dcmftest`) to validate and send the files in controlled batches with logging, concurrency control, and system load handling.
